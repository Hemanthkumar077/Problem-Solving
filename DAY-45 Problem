Input: [3, 1, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5] 
You are given an array of integers. Rearrange the array such that: 
1. All even numbers appear before all odd numbers. 
2. Within the even and odd groups, numbers should maintain their 
relative order from the original array. 
3. The rearrangement must be done in-place (without using extra 
arrays). 
Output: [2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 7, 5]


def rearrange(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    j = 0  # pointer for position of next even

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:  # if even
            temp = arr[i]
            # shift all elements between j and i-1 to the right
            k = i
            while k > j:
                arr[k] = arr[k - 1]
                k -= 1
            arr[j] = temp
            j += 1  # move boundary for next even

# Example
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]
rearrange(arr)
print(arr)  # [2, 4, 6, 3, 1, 7, 5]
