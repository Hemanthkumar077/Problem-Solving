 Write a program that takes array of numbers as input and a number as 
second input. Check the position of the factorial of the second input 
number in the given array. Print the position of it. If the factorial of 
given second input number is not presented in the array then print 
factorial of  the number is not presented. 
Testcase1 :  [ 61, 4, 6, 7, 120 , 10 ] 
Input :  5 
Output : 4



a =  [ 61, 4, 6, 7, 120 , 10 ] 
b = 5
fact = 1
for i in range(1,b+1):
    fact = fact * i
if fact in a :
    print(a.index(fact))
else :
    print("not present")
