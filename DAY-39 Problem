#  Find Peak Element 

# Problem: Write a function to find a peak element in an array. An 
# element is a peak if it is not smaller than its neighbours. 
# Testcase 1: 
# Input: [1, 3, 20, 4, 1, 0] 
# Output: 20


n = [1,3,20,4,1,0]
max = n[0]
for i in range(1,len(n)):
    if n[i] > max :
        max = n[i]
print(max)
