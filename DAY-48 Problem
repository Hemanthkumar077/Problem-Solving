def first_non_repeating(s):
    freq = {}
    
    # Count frequency of each character
    for ch in s:
        if ch in freq:
            freq[ch] += 1
        else:
            freq[ch] = 1
    
    # Find first character with frequency 1
    for ch in s:
        if freq[ch] == 1:
            return ch
    return None   # if no non-repeating character
        

# Testcase 1
print(first_non_repeating("swiss"))
